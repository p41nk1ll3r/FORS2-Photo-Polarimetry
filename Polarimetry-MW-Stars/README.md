These catalogs present optical polarimetric estimates (BVRI) that have been assigned to Milky Way stars by crossing the astrometry derived celestial coordinates of sources in the observed fields (identified in the files names) with celestial coordinates of GAIA DR3 objects (those with measured proper motions).

These polarimetric estimates were obtained by performing apperture photometry on each beam measurement, calculating each star polarization, subtracting the instrumental polarization and subtracting the median of all stars in the field (our estimate for interstellar polarization).
